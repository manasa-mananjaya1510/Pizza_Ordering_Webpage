# Pizza Ordering Wepage

This project aims to develop a web application that allows users to manage a pizza menu. The application adheres to specific requirements, including the use of valid XHTML 5 for all pages and the ability to work regardless of the folder location chosen by the grader. The project follows a modular approach, where the main functionality is implemented in the index.php file and divided into four distinct functions: menuView, editPizzaView, detailView, and confirmView. Each function is responsible for rendering a specific page, such as the landing page, create/edit pizza page, pizza detail/update popularity page, and confirm deletion page, respectively.

The application incorporates various features, such as navigation links, form submissions, and data storage. The landing page displays the pizza menu, with links to the detail page for each pizza and an option to edit or delete a pizza. The popularity of a pizza is represented by the number of hearts, which is calculated based on the number of times the detail page has been viewed. The create/edit pizza pages allow users to add or modify pizza information, which is stored in a text file specific to each pizza.

Furthermore, the project ensures data integrity by enforcing required fields, such as pizza name and price, during pizza creation. The delete confirmation page enables users to confirm or cancel the deletion of a pizza, with the corresponding actions performed accordingly. Overall, this project demonstrates the implementation of a functional web application for managing a pizza menu, incorporating essential features and adhering to specific requirements.
